# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System with Spark MLlib

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a collaborative filtering recommendation system using **Apache Spark MLlib**. The system leverages the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm to provide personalized recommendations on a large-scale dataset. The focus is on optimizing the machine learning pipeline through model implementation and performance evaluation.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a **collaborative filtering** recommendation model using Spark's distributed MLlib library.
- Scalable data processing and machine learning with **Spark's Scala API**.
- Performance analysis to evaluate trade-offs between model quality and computational efficiency.

## Objective

The project aims to:
- Apply **collaborative filtering** to solve recommendation problems using Spark.
- Demonstrate practical skills in distributed machine learning and data analysis.
- Analyze and improve model performance using real-world datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark** (MLlib for machine learning)
- **Scala** for Spark development
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Scala kernel) for interactive development and analysis
